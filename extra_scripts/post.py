"""
Post-upload script for PlatformIO

This script runs after successful firmware upload and performs the following actions:
1. Renames secrets.json to secrets.json.injected to indicate successful injection
2. Preserves previous injected files with timestamps
3. Provides clear feedback about the secrets injection status

Usage:
- Automatically runs after: pio run -e <env> --target upload
- Helps track which secrets have been injected into firmware
- Prevents accidental reuse of the same secrets file

To reuse secrets: cp secrets.json.injected secrets.json
